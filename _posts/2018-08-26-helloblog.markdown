I began to take an interest in web development a few years ago when a friend helped me write some code to generate a report on my employees. I was the marketing director of a local home improvement company and I couldn't get some data generated in an easy end of day report. All the data was in my CSM, but there was no way to make it put all the data into a single report. Phone calls to the company that created the software was no help. I was complaining to a friend of mine when he suggested that he could help me write some code to generate a custom report since our CSM was entirely online, we only needed an API. The company agreed to send me the API and a short while later, I had the report I needed and I owed my friend a really good lunch. I was really excited, not just for having the report but because we made it happen ourselves. 
My friend encouraged me to look into learning JavaScript and suggested some resources. I spent some time on CodeCademy, CodeSchool, TeamTreeHouse, and freeCodeCamp. After finishing the Front End portion of freeCodeCamp I decided that this is what I wanted to do. My job averaged around eighty hours each week and didn't leave me much time to take learning web development seriously. I left that job and took a position that affords me more flexibility even though the pay isn't nearly as good. 
Now I am working through the FlatIron School's curiculum so that I can gain the necessary skills and experience needed to get my career started. While learning I have been frustrated and excited at various times. As frustrating as it can be when my code doesn't work, I enjoy solving the puzzle and the harder the puzzle, the more satisfaction I feel in solving it. I know that the road ahead will be difficult as I expand my thinking with new concepts. I am ready for the challenge and look forward to creating my own projects with what I learn.
